This guide is the main source of documentation for users that are getting started with the long pipeline name . The ./ervx pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems.

It relies on technologies like Singularity 1 to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by Snakemake 2 , a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster. The pipeline is compatible with data generated from Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. As input, it accepts a set of FastQ files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users. Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the usage section of each available sub command.

The cache sub command can also be used to pull our pre-built reference bundles onto a new cluster or target system. The cache sub command creates local cache on the filesysytem for resources hosted on DockerHub or AWS S3. These resources are normally pulled onto the filesystem when the pipeline runs; however, due to network issues or DockerHub pull rate limits, it may make sense to pull the resources once so a shared cache can be created and re-used.

About \u00b6 The ervx executable is composed of several inter-related sub commands. Please see ervx -h for all available options. This part of the documentation describes options and concepts for ervx run sub command in more detail. With minimal configuration, the run sub command enables you to start running ervx pipeline. Setting up the ervx pipeline is fast and easy! In its most basic form, ervx run only has two required inputs . 2. Synopsis \u00b6 $ ervx run [--help] \\ [--mode {slurm,uge,local}] [--job-name JOB_NAME] [--batch-id BATCH_ID] \\ [--tmp-dir TMP_DIR] [--silent] [--sif-cache SIF_CACHE] \\ [--singularity-cache SINGULARITY_CACHE] \\ [--dry-run] [--threads THREADS] \\ --input INPUT [INPUT ...] \\ --output OUTPUT The synopsis for each command shows its arguments and their usage. Optional arguments are shown in square brackets. A user must provide a list of FastQ (globbing is supported) to analyze via --input argument and an output directory to store results via --output argument. Use you can always use the -h option for information on a specific command. 2.1 Required arguments \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are required. Failure to provide a required argument will result in a non-zero exit-code. --input INPUT [INPUT ...] Input FastQ or BAM file(s). type: file(s) One or more FastQ files can be provided. The pipeline does NOT support single-end data. From the command-line, each input file should seperated by a space. Globbing is supported! This makes selecting FastQ files easy. Input FastQ files should always be gzipp-ed. Example: --input .tests/*.R?.fastq.gz --output OUTPUT Path to an output directory. type: path This location is where the pipeline will create all of its output files, also known as the pipeline's working directory. If the provided output directory does not exist, it will be created automatically. Example: --output /data/$USER/ervx_out --genome {hg38_20,mm10_70,hg19_19} This option defines the reference genome for your set of samples. On Biowulf and Locus, ervx does comes bundled with pre built reference files for human and mouse samples. Example: --genome mm10_70 2.2 Analysis options \u00b6 --star-2-pass-basic Run STAR in per sample 2-pass mapping mode. type: boolean It is recommended to use this option when processing a set of unrelated samples or when processing samples in a clinical setting. It is not adivsed to use this option for a study with multiple related samples. By default, the pipeline ultilizes a multi sample 2-pass mapping approach where the set of splice junctions detected across all samples are provided to the second pass of STAR. This option overrides the default behavior so each sample will be processed in a per sample two-pass basic mode. This option should not be combined with the small RNA option. If the two options are combined, STAR will run in pass basic mode. Example: --star-2-pass-basic 2.3 Orchestration options \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are optional, and do not need to be provided, except that --sif-cache --mode --tmp-dir and --shared-resources are required options on Locus. --dry-run Dry run the pipeline. type: boolean flag Displays what steps in the pipeline remain or will be run. Does not execute anything! Example: --dry-run --shared-resources SHARED_RESOURCES Local path to shared resources. type: path The pipeline uses a set of shared reference files that can be re-used across reference genomes. These currently include reference files for kraken and FQScreen. These reference files can be downloaded with the build sub command's --shared-resources option. With that being said, these files only need to be downloaded once. We recommend storing this files in a shared location on the filesystem that other people can access. If you are running the pipeline on Biowulf, you do NOT need to download these reference files! They already exist on the filesystem in a location that anyone can acceess; however, if you are running the pipeline on another cluster or target system, you will need to download the shared resources with the build sub command, and you will need to provide this option every time you run the pipeline. Please provide the same path that was provided to the build sub command's --shared-resources option. Again, if you are running the pipeline on Biowulf, you do NOT need to provide this option. For more information about how to download shared resources, please reference the build sub command's --shared-resources option. This is a required option on Locus, shared resources are already on Locus in /hpcdata/openomics/references/ervx/SHARED_RESOURCES/. Example: --shared-resources /hpcdata/openomics/references/ervx/SHARED_RESOURCES/ --silent Silence standard output. type: boolean flag Reduces the amount of information directed to standard output when submitting master job to the job scheduler. Only the job id of the master job is returned. Example: --silent --mode {slurm,uge,local} Execution Method. type: string default: slurm Execution Method. Defines the mode or method of execution. Vaild mode options include: slurm or local. slurm The slurm execution method will submit jobs to the SLURM workload manager . It is recommended running ervx in this mode as execution will be significantly faster in a distributed environment. This is the default mode of execution. uge The uge execution method will submit jobs to the UGE workload manager . This option is required on Locus . local Local executions will run serially on compute instance. This is useful for testing, debugging, or when a users does not have access to a high performance computing environment. If this option is not provided, it will default to a local execution mode. Example: --mode slurm --job-name JOB_NAME Set the name of the pipeline's master job. type: string default: pl:ervx When submitting the pipeline to a job scheduler, like SLURM, this option always you to set the name of the pipeline's master job. By default, the name of the pipeline's master job is set to \"pl:ervx\". Example: --job-name pl_id-42 --singularity-cache SINGULARITY_CACHE Overrides the $SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR environment variable. type: path default: --output OUTPUT/.singularity Singularity will cache image layers pulled from remote registries. This ultimately speeds up the process of pull an image from DockerHub if an image layer already exists in the singularity cache directory. By default, the cache is set to the value provided to the --output argument. Please note that this cache cannot be shared across users. Singularity strictly enforces you own the cache directory and will return a non-zero exit code if you do not own the cache directory! See the --sif-cache option to create a shareable resource. Example: --singularity-cache /data/$USER/.singularity --sif-cache SIF_CACHE Path where a local cache of SIFs are stored. type: path Uses a local cache of SIFs on the filesystem. This SIF cache can be shared across users if permissions are set correctly. If a SIF does not exist in the SIF cache, the image will be pulled from Dockerhub and a warning message will be displayed. The ervx cache subcommand can be used to create a local SIF cache. Please see ervx cache for more information. This command is extremely useful for avoiding DockerHub pull rate limits. It also remove any potential errors that could occur due to network issues or DockerHub being temporarily unavailable. We recommend running ervx with this option when ever possible. This option is required on Locus . Example: --singularity-cache /data/$USER/SIFs Example for Locus: --singularity-cache /hpcdata/openomics/SIFs/ --threads THREADS Max number of threads for each process. type: int default: 2 Max number of threads for each process. This option is more applicable when running the pipeline with --mode local . It is recommended setting this vaule to the maximum number of CPUs available on the host machine. Example: --threads 12 --tmp-dir TMP_DIR Max number of threads for each process. type: path default: /lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID Path on the file system for writing temporary output files. By default, the temporary directory is set to '/lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID' for backwards compatibility with the NIH's Biowulf cluster; however, if you are running the pipeline on another cluster, this option will need to be specified. Ideally, this path should point to a dedicated location on the filesystem for writing tmp files. On many systems, this location is set to somewhere in /scratch. If you need to inject a variable into this string that should NOT be expanded, please quote this options value in single quotes. This option is required on Locus . On Locus this directory is '/hpcdata/scratch/'. Example: --tmp-dir /scratch/$USER/ Example for Locus: --tmp-dir /hpcdata/scratch/ 2.4 Miscellaneous options \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are optional, and do not need to be provided. -h, --help Display Help. type: boolean flag Shows command's synopsis, help message, and an example command Example: --help 3.
